## Abstract

Smart city applications, especially in urban mobility, rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance various tasks, including traffic accident prevention through driver attention monitoring. Assessing fatigue and distraction levels is critical but challenging due to the rarity and danger of such scenarios, resulting in unbalanced datasets where the most relevant cases are underrepresented. To address this, we leveraged leading free Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) platforms to create a synthetic dataset depicting drivers in normal and fatigued conditions. The images generated by Copilot and Midjourney were evaluated using a natural fatigue monitoring system trained on real human data. Copilot achieved superior results among the platforms, with 92.73% precision, 100.00% sensitivity, 93.22% specificity, and an F1-score 96.23%. We also explored Stable Diffusion for its enhanced control over image generation but identified opportunities for optimization. These findings highlight the potential of GenAI-generated datasets to augment datasets for driver attention monitoring. Our dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/nataliameira/fatigue\_synthetic\_data.

## Prompts Used
Below are all the example prompts used to generate synthetic data. Prompts were carefully crafted to simulate drivers under specific conditions. Adjust ethnicity and other characteristics as necessary:

1. *Generate a photo of a realistic woman’s face. The woman is inside a car. She is the driver. Her face must be centered, from the bust to the head. Dark gray T-shirt. The head is slightly tilted to the right. The woman must have dark black skin, brown eyes, and hair. The woman must not be wearing makeup. The woman's eyes must be closed. The woman must be a little fat.*
2. *Generate a photo of a realistic woman’s face. The woman is inside a car. The woman is the driver of the car. The image must be centered, from the bust to the head. Dark gray T-shirt. The woman's head is slightly tilted to the right. The woman must have dark black skin, brown eyes, and hair. The woman's hair must be afro curly and short at ear level. The woman's eyes must be closed. The woman is fat.*
3. *Generate a photo of a realistic woman's face. The woman is inside a car. The woman is the driver of the car. The image must be centered, from bust to head. Dark gray t-shirt. The woman's head is tilted slightly to the right. Her eyes must be closed and sleepy.*
4. *Generate a photo of a realistic woman's face. The woman is inside a car. The woman is the driver of the car. The image must be centered, from bust to head. Dark gray t-shirt. The woman's head is tilted slightly to the right. Her eyes must be closed and sleepy. The woman is yawning. Generate the image in portrait mode.*
5. *Generate a photo of a realistic man's face. The man is inside a car. The man is the driver of the car. The image must be centered, from bust to head. Dark gray t-shirt. The man's head is tilted slightly to the right. The eyes must be closed and drowsy. The man is yawning.*
6. *Generate a photo of a realistic man's face. The man is inside a car. The man is the driver of the car. The image must be centered, from bust to head. Dark gray t-shirt. The man's head is tilted slightly to the right. The man must have dark black skin, brown eyes and hair. The man's hair must be afro curly and short at ear level. The man's eyes must be closed. The man is fat.*
7. *Generate a photo of a realistic man's face. The man is inside a car. The man is the driver of the car. The eyes must be closed and drowsy. The man is yawning softly. The image must be centered, from bust to head. Dark gray t-shirt. The man's head is tilted slightly to the right.*
